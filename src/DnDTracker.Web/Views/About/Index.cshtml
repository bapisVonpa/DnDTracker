                        <strong>DnDTracker</strong> was started to help the previously mentioned developers learn full-stack integration with ASP.NET (C#), Sass, AWS, and Travis CI. Nathan Duncan filled the role of resident pseudo-expert on DnD. His efforts provided all the requirements on what the team would need to design the application for players and for dungeon masters. Andrew Schlein provided a creative interpretation of the website, simplifying the user experience. The core and architecture of <strong>DnDTracker</strong> was designed by Derek Williamson. <strong>DnDTracker's</strong> UI design was overseen by Tyler Carey.

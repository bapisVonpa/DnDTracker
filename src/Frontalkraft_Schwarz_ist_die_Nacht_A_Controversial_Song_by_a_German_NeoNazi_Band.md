The song is a tribute to the Nazi SS, the paramilitary organization that was responsible for many atrocities during World War II. The lyrics praise the SS as "the black guard of the FÃ¼hrer" and "the elite of the Germanic race". The song also glorifies war and violence, and expresses hatred for Jews, communists, and democracy. The chorus of the song goes:

> Schwarz ist die Nacht
 In der wir euch holen
 Schwarz ist das Licht
 Das euch wird erhellen
 Schwarz ist die Farbe
 Die wir stolz tragen
 Schwarz ist die Nacht
 In der wir euch schlagen

Which translates to:

> Black is the night
 In which we will get you
 Black is the light
 That will enlighten you
 Black is the color
 That we proudly wear
 Black is the night
 In which we will beat you

The song has been banned in Germany for inciting hatred and violence, and violating the constitution. However, it can still be found online on various platforms, such as YouTube[^2^] and Dailymotion[^1^]. Some websites also offer illegal downloads of the song[^3^]. The song has been criticized by anti-fascist groups, human rights organizations, and Holocaust survivors, who have condemned it as an insult to the victims of Nazi crimes and a threat to democracy.
  
Frontalkraft is not the only neo-Nazi band that uses music as a propaganda tool. According to the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, there are about 200 active right-wing extremist music groups in Germany, with a total of about 10,000 followers. These groups produce and distribute CDs, DVDs, and online streams of songs that promote neo-Nazi ideology and incite violence against minorities and political opponents. Some of these groups also organize concerts and festivals, where they recruit new members and collect funds for their activities.
 
The German authorities have been trying to crack down on the neo-Nazi music scene, by banning some of the groups and their songs, confiscating their materials, and prosecuting their members. However, the neo-Nazi music scene is constantly evolving and adapting to new technologies and platforms, such as social media, podcasts, and streaming services. The neo-Nazi music scene also has international connections and influences, as some of the groups collaborate with or are inspired by similar groups from other countries, such as the United States, Russia, Sweden, and Greece.
 
The neo-Nazi music scene poses a serious threat to the democratic values and social cohesion of Germany and Europe. The music not only spreads hate and violence, but also creates a sense of identity and belonging for the neo-Nazi subculture. The music also serves as a gateway for young people to join the neo-Nazi movement, as it appeals to their emotions and frustrations. Therefore, it is important to counter the neo-Nazi music scene with education, awareness, and dialogue, as well as legal and social measures.
